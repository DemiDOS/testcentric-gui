# How to contribute

So you're thinking about contributing to TestCentric? Great! Maintaining and enhancing the TestCentric GUI is a big job, so **the community's help is really appreciated.**

Helping out isn't just writing code, it also includes submitting issues, helping confirm issues, working on the website, helping people on the [mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/nunit-discuss) and improving the documentation.
